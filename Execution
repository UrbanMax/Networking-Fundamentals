Here is the breakdown of the solutions and explanations for each phase in the networking fundamentals challenge:

Phase 1: “I’d like to Teach the World to ping”
Command(s) used to run ping against the IP ranges:

fping -sS 161.35.96.20 192.0.2.0

Summarize the results of the ping command(s):
2 IP addresses are alive and responding to echo requests.

List of IPs responding to echo requests:
161.35.96.20 is alive
192.0.2.0 is alive

Explain which OSI layer(s) your findings involve:
ICMP ping (echo request and response) operates at OSI Layer 3 (Network Layer).
Mitigation recommendations (if needed):
Ensure secure configurations and authentication methods for services like SSH on 161.35.96.20.

Phase 2: “Some SYN for Nothin’”
Which ports are open on the RockStar Corp server?
Port 22/tcp (SSH) is open.

Which OSI layer do SYN scans run on?
SYN scans operate at the Transport Layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model.

Mitigation suggestions (if needed):
Implement ACLs or firewall rules to restrict access to authorized IP addresses.

Phase 3: “I Feel a DNS Change Comin’ On”
Summarize your findings about why access to rollingstone.com is not working as expected from the RockStar Corp Hollywood office:
The issue may be due to DNS resolution problems or potentially malicious redirection.

Command used to query Domain Name System records:

cat /etc/hosts
nslookup 98.137.246.8

Explain what OSI layer DNS runs on:
DNS operates at OSI Layer 7 (Application Layer).

Mitigation suggestions (if needed):
Review and rectify hosts file entries, and ensure proper DNS configuration to prevent potential DNS hijacking.

Phase 4: “ShARP Dressed Man”
Name of file containing packets:
secretlogs.pcapng
ARP findings identifying the hacker’s MAC address:
Duplicate MAC address (00:0c:29:1d:b3:b1) for IP 192.168.47.200.

HTTP findings, including the message from the hacker:
The HTTP message includes details about SSH (Port 22) being open and vulnerable to exploitation.

Explain the OSI layers for HTTP and ARP:
HTTP operates at OSI Layer 7 (Application Layer).
ARP operates at OSI Layer 2 (Link Layer).

Mitigation suggestions (if needed):
Remove unauthorized MAC addresses, change compromised passwords, and isolate affected systems.
